## About
Hello! As I'm sure you can tell from the details above, my name is Thomas Clark. I am a freelance contract Software Engineer, Web Developer, and IT Consultant living in the somewhat rural Southeast Alaskan town of Ketchikan. I have never been particularly fond of writing out these sort of "_short biography/about me_" type of sections, and tend to find myself at a loss for what to mention.
